We explore the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset and test machine learning algorithms that predict tumors to be either benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).

bcp.R - extracts the dataset and performs data exploration

training.R - performs different machine learning alorgirthms, creates an ensemble, and compares accuracies
